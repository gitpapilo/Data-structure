<h1>Problem 1</h1>
 <br><br>
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set.
<br>In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.<br>
Example:<br>
<h3>Set 1 :</h3> [3, 1, 7, 9], <h3>Set 2:</h3> [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]<br>
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
  <br>
  Give a solutions to this problem, using arrays

<h1>Problem 2 </h1><br>
Write an algorithm that fulfill the following: 
<br><br>
<h3>Name:</h3> Dot product<br>
<h3>Description:</h3>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps,<br> the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)</li><br>
<li>Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, <br>by calling the procedure defined in the previous question.<br> The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.</li><br>
    <li>Modify the previous algorithm if you use a dot_product function instead of a procedure.</li>
  </ul>
